##  Arrays too!

```javascript
const [firstPlace, secondPlace] = winnersList;
```

<div>
A "clever" way to swap to variables:

```javascript
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

[b, a] = [a, b];

console.log(a, b); // 2, 1
```
</div>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

note:
    Put your speaker notes here.
    You can see them pressing 's'.
